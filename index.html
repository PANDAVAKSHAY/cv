        <p class="p2">Computer skills involve the ability to learn and operate various technology. Hardware skills allow you to physically
            operate a computer and can be as simple as knowing how to turn devices on and off. Software skills help you to
            efficiently use computer programmes and applications. There are some software skills that employers may consider as
            prerequisites to employment like using spreadsheets or knowing a certain coding language.</p>
