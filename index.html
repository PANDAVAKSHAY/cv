   <h3>Computer Skills</h3>
   <p>Computer skills involve the ability to learn and operate various technology. Hardware skills allow you to physically
operate a computer and can be as simple as knowing how to turn devices on and off. Software skills help you to

prerequisites to employment like using spreadsheets or knowing a certain coding language.</p>
